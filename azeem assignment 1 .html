    <h1>Hello Sir! Muhammad Azeem Here </h1>
    <p>TOnce upon a time, in a quirky little town called Punnyville, there lived a group of animals who loved to tell jokes. These animals weren't your ordinary creatures; they had a unique talent for making people laugh with their witty wordplay.

        The leader of this merry band was a clever fox named Felix. Felix was renowned for his punny jokes that always left everyone in stitches. He had a laugh that sounded like a mix between a hyena and a kazoo, and it was infectious. Whenever Felix started laughing, you couldn't help but join in, even if you didn't quite get the joke.
        
        One sunny day, Felix gathered his friends for a pun-off competition in the town square. There was Polly the parrot, who could mimic any voice, including celebrity impersonations. Then there was Barry the bear, who told jokes with such a deadpan delivery that you never knew if he was serious or joking. And finally, there was Lenny the squirrel, who had an uncanny ability to turn everyday situations into hilarious tales.
        
        The competition began, and the town's residents gathered to watch. Felix started with one of his classics: "Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything!" The crowd erupted in laughter, and even the nearby trees seemed to shake with amusement.
        
        Polly the parrot took the stage next, imitating famous voices while delivering jokes. She channeled her inner Arnold Schwarzenegger and said, "I asked my computer if it could sing me a song, and it said, 'I can't. My motherboard!'" The crowd roared with laughter, and some folks even clutched their bellies in pain.
        
        Barry the bear followed, and he delivered a joke so deadpan that people couldn't tell if he was joking or not: "I used to play piano by ear, but now I use my hands." The confusion only made it funnier, and soon, everyone was giggling uncontrollably.
        
        Finally, Lenny the squirrel stepped up. He began, "I decided to make a belt out of watches, but it was a waist of time." The pun was so pun-tastic that even the birds in the trees were chirping with delight.
        
        The competition went on for hours, with each animal trying to out-pun the other. The crowd laughed until tears streamed down their faces. In the end, they declared it a tie because everyone's puns were so hilarious that they couldn't choose a winner.
        
        As the sun set over Punnyville, the animals and the townsfolk sat together, still chuckling at the day's puns. They realized that laughter truly brought everyone together, and they decided to make every day a day of laughter in their town.
        
        From that day forward, Punnyville became the happiest place on Earth, where puns ruled, and laughter never stopped. And if you ever visit, don't be surprised if you find yourself laughing so hard that your own laughter joins the joyful chorus of Punnyville..</p>
